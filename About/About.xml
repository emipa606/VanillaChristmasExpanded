Vanilla Christmas Expanded is what could easily be described as a temporary, festive mini-mod. Celebrate Christmas on the Rim, add some colour to your colonies and await Christmas presents!

This mod adds several new mechanics to the game, most notably a Christmas tree, being a 1x1 structure, enhancing the beauty of every room and allowing for a new event to occur - Presents!
New structure - a fireplace, as well as a whole lot of eggnog are there to allow you to have a truly festive period.
